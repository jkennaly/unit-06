# Treehouse Techdegree unit-06

## Portfolio Site

This project is a code portfolio site, displaying my Treehouse Techdegree projects and FestivalTime, a hobby project I work on.

### Portfolio app

The portfolio is running as an Express app on Node. The pages are written as pug templates and populated with data based on the route URL.

#### NPM scripting

A start script was added to package.json so that running 'npm start' from the command line will start the server.

#### Error messages

Error messages (including for invalid routes) are also handled by populating a pug template with the error data.

#### Styling

This app was built from a template, with some styling changes made. The styling changes are made in jbk.css, with the template css untouched.

##### Sidebar

The color on sidebar was changed to a dark green, with a gradient form black starting at the bottom.

##### Main Panel

The background color was set to a pinkish #FFDDFF.

##### Main Headings

An orange text shadow was added to all H1 text.
